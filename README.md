# Welcome to the NearForm React Amsterdam Browser Hooks Challenge 2019

At NearForm, our front end developers saw a problem whereby everyday browser events
were polluting the core functionality of components. It forced us to use Classes to manage state, registering and deregistering events using lifecycle methods, not to mention catering for browser compatibility. It was a case of re-inventing the wheel everytime we wanted to use a core browser event and related functions.

Custom hooks made it possible to create a neat and tidy re-usable library called [React Browser Hooks](https://github.com/nearform/react-browser-hooks) that puts all code related to specific browser functionalty into modular custom hooks.

With one line of code you can now import functionality would previously have polluted a component with sometimes 50 or more extra lines of code, not to mention the time saved looking up Stack Overflow and catering for
edge cases, multiple browsers etc.

We want you to use our browser hooks library to create something interestting. Be creative, make it fun and use as many hooks as you like.

Please visit our [component storybook](https://react-browser-hooks.netlify.com) to see examples of each hook in action and read the documentation.

## Rules of Engagement

Follow these 3 simple steps:

1. `Create` a branch from this repository
2. `Clone` it, 'npm install' and 'npm start' to make sure it works locally
3. `Import` as many of the hooks as you like into your App and get busy!

When done, simply make a pull request and tag @cianfoley-nearform we will evaluate in due course.

## Scoring

You will get up to 20 marks for each of the evaluation criteria:

- `50 marks` based on what your `working` app does
- `20 marks` for the best use of our browser hooks and how many were used
- `10 marks` for great code
- `10 marks` for use of react hooks / custom hooks, we don't want to see Classes
- `10 marks` for best suggestions of hooks not included in our library and your feedback (please add this in the comments section of your PR)

## Winners

That's it. Winners will be announced as soon as we get through all entries.

We will merge the winning branch into the repository :-)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
